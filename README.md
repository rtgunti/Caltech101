# Caltech101
Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks
This is a team project for the task of Image classification on
Caltech101 data set. We considered Deep Convolutional Neural Network with Confusion
Matrix for implementation and evaluation of the dataset. The dataset is highly unbalanced
and also contains class imbalance problem. The goal is to be able to find suitable methods to
classify the images.
